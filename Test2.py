Using logger.debug with df.count() for debugging purposes still involves the same performance considerations, as the underlying call to df.count() will trigger a full data scan and break Spark's lazy evaluation. Here are some tailored recommendations to handle logging while minimizing performance degradation:Performance Implications of logger.debug(df.count())Full Data Scan: Every call to df.count() results in Spark processing the entire DataFrame, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive.Repeated Computation: If the DataFrame is not cached, each df.count() call will recompute the transformations leading up to that point.RecommendationsReduce Frequency:Limit the number of times df.count() is called. Use it only at critical points where knowing the exact count is essential for debugging.Caching:Use caching strategically if you need to count multiple times on the same DataFrame:df.cache()
logger.debug(f"Count after step X: {df.count()}")Caching stores the DataFrame in memory, reducing repeated computations and improving performance.Sample Logging:Instead of counting the entire DataFrame, log a sample of the data to understand the structure and contents:sample_data = df.limit(5).collect()
logger.debug(f"Sample data: {sample_data}")
