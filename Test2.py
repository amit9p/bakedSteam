Hi @KabanerTeamLead,
As part of the SCC calculation, we identified an upstream requirement to roll up Account Closure Reason into a derived status (closed_by_consumer / closed_by_grantor).
Per the spec, this roll-up is expected to be handled by the Card consolidator, with the calculator consuming only the derived value.
Can you confirm if this is owned by the Kabaner team and when we can expect availability? Happy to sync if needed.
