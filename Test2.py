This dataset provides the order value for bucket allocation within a financial transaction, ensuring that the allocation follows a specific sequence rather than the systemâ€™s default. It is primarily intended for analysts, finance teams, and data engineers who need to validate, track, or reconcile how funds are distributed across different categories. The data originates from the transaction processing system, where overrides are applied whenever a business rule or manual adjustment requires a different allocation than the default setting.
