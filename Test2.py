The resources used by your Glue job (disk, CPU, network) are not shared with other jobs once allocated. While minor improvements in overall network or storage performance might occur during low-traffic times, AWS is built to scale efficiently, and the performance difference will generally be small. Thus, the statement is not entirely correct in suggesting that load from other companies would directly impact your job's speed in any significant way.
