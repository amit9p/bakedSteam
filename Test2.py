This dataset contains historical transactional details originally recorded in the legacy RECAP system for Omega charge-off accounts. It includes only converted charge-off account activity and serves as a legacy dataset that has been migrated into OneStream for reference and compliance needs. The dataset supports archival, audit, and reporting requirements but does not capture new or ongoing transactions.
