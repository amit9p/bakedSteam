This dataset provides a complete view of customer-level information that is reported to credit bureaus for accounts in recoveries. It is designed to support compliance teams, credit reporting analysts, and auditors by ensuring transparency and consistency in how customer data is shared externally. Unlike account-level extracts, this dataset focuses specifically on customer attributes and identifiers, giving users the ability to validate reporting accuracy at the customer dimension. The data is sourced from the Omega System of Record and delivered daily through the Credit Bureau Reporting Service pipeline.
