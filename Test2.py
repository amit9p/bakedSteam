An assertion is used to check if a condition is true, and if not, it raises an AssertionError. Typically, you would use it like this:assert df.count() > 0, f"df has number of records {df.count()}"This statement checks if the DataFrame df has more than 0 records. If it doesn't, it raises an error with the message indicating the number of records in df.
