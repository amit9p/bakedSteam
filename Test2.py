Suggestion: Rather than using multiple withColumn calls with hardcoded default values, consider creating a dictionary to store default values for each column. This approach will make the code cleaner, reduce redundancy, and make it easier to modify default values in the future.

Reason: Currently, the code uses withColumn repeatedly, which makes it lengthy and slightly difficult to read. Using a dictionary with a loop can streamline this by consolidating the default values in one place, which enhances maintainability.


Example:

# Define default values in a dictionary
default_values = {
    "identification_number": "U631AZz",
    "cycle_identifier": "BI",
    "portfolio_type": "0",
    "credit_limit": None,
    "scheduled_payment_amount": None,
    # Add other fields here
}

# Apply defaults using a loop
for col_name, default_value in default_values.items():
    base_segment_df = base_segment_df.withColumn(col_name, lit(default_value))

Benefit: This makes the code more scalable. If additional fields need defaults, you can simply add them to the dictionary without writing new withColumn statements
