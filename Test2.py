The Calculated Accounts J2 Customer dataset provides account-level summaries for each reportable U.S. Card account and its associated J2 customer. It applies Line-of-Business configuration rules and suppression logic required for delivery to credit reporting agencies. The dataset structures results in an attribute-value format so downstream systems can consume a consistent set of calculated Metro2 segment fields, as well as outputs for Small Business Financial Exchange (SBFE), Early Warning Services (EWS), and CSV formats.

This dataset is primarily used by bureau reporting teams, credit risk groups, data engineering partners, and analytics teams who need a single, trusted view of calculated account and J2 customer details for credit bureau reporting, monitoring, and reconciliation. It helps consumers of this data verify reporting accuracy, support audit and compliance needs, and consistently generate bureau-ready summary records.

The data originates from U.S. Card operational systems of record. It is processed through the Enterprise Credit Bureau Reporting (eCBR) transformation workflows, where it is standardized according to the Credit Reporting Resource Guide (CRRG) and prepared for bureau submission.
