Current Code Pattern (Repeated Conditionals)

Your logic has many repeated when(...) blocks like:

when(manual_delete_code_exists, lit(ACCOUNT_STATUS_DA))
when(is_terminal_notification_true, lit(ACCOUNT_STATUS_DA))
when(is_aged_debt_notification_true, lit(ACCOUNT_STATUS_DA))

They are clean and correct, but since many of them lead to the same output (e.g., DA), you could group related flags into one block to reduce repetition.

âœ… Suggested Grouped Style (Optional Refactor)

when(
    manual_delete_code_exists |
    is_terminal_notification_true |
    (is_deceased_notification_true_acct_type_8a) |
    is_aged_debt_notification_true,
    lit(ACCOUNT_STATUS_DA)
)

This:

Keeps the logic tight

Reduces vertical length

Improves readability if the logic grows
