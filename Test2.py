The Formatted Fields dataset provides United States (US) Card customer account information that has been processed through the Enterprise Credit Bureau Reporting (eCBR) pipeline. Its purpose is to supply a standardized, ready-to-use view of account data for credit-bureau reporting and analysis.

The data is standardized according to the Credit Reporting Resource Guide (CRRG) and organized in an attribute–value structure so that consumers do not need to apply bureau-specific formatting rules themselves. Using this dataset, downstream jobs can generate multiple credit-reporting formats, including the Metro2® credit reporting format (Metro2), Score-to-File Service (S2FS) layouts, Early Warning System (EWS) layouts, and comma-separated values (CSV) files (CSV).

Source: The dataset is sourced from upstream US Card account processing systems and then transformed, validated, and standardized by the Enterprise Credit Bureau Reporting (eCBR) pipeline after data-quality and business-rule checks.

This dataset is intended for data engineering, data quality, compliance, risk, and reporting teams that prepare, validate, or analyze credit-bureau submissions. It helps these users retrieve structured, consistent, and bureau-agnostic customer account information without having to manage raw input transformations.
