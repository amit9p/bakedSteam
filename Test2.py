Example Scenario:

If you spend $10,000 annually and it's spread evenly across travel, dining, and other purchases, with the Chase Sapphire Preferred, your rewards could be as follows:

$3,000 on travel (using the 5x travel bonus on Chase): 15,000 points.

$2,000 on dining: 6,000 points.

$5,000 on other categories: 5,000 points.


This gives you a total of 26,000 points, which can be worth up to $325 when redeemed for travel through Chase Ultimate Rewards. This could justify the annual fee, but you would need to factor in how much value you get from travel perks like insurance, lounge access, or the sign-up bonus.


In contrast, with a 2% cash back card, the same $10,000 in spending would give you $200 cash back, with no annual fee to worry about.

Conclusion:

Choose the 2% cash back card if you prefer simplicity and want to avoid annual fees while still earning decent rewards.

Choose the Chase Sapphire Preferred if you travel frequently and can take advantage of the higher rewards and travel perks, or if you can maximize the value of the points transfer to travel partners.
