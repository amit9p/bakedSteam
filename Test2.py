This dataset provides calculated account-level details along with the associated primary customer for U.S. Card accounts. The data is produced by the Enterprise Credit Bureau Reporting (eCBR) pipeline, where raw customer and account data from U.S. Card systems of record is processed, standardized, and transformed according to the Credit Reporting Resource Guide (CRRG) requirements. It applies configured Line-of-Business logic and suppression rules to determine which accounts should be delivered to the credit reporting agencies.

The dataset is structured in an attribute-value format so downstream teams can consume a consistent set of calculated fields across reporting formats such as Metro2, SBFE, EWS, and CSV. Source: The data originates from U.S. Card operational systems, is processed through eCBR transformation jobs, and is generated as part of the bureau reporting preparation workflow.
