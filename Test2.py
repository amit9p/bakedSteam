---

**Introduction:**

"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. I’m here to present the PI readout for the CoBRa Swift team."

**Sprint Capacity:**

"Starting with our sprint capacity, we have a team of 4 engineers. In Sprint 1, we have an available capacity of 15 with a planned capacity of 16, achieving 106% planning. Sprint 2 has 17 available and 14 planned, giving us 82%. Lastly, Sprint 3 shows a drop with 17 available and 5 planned, reflecting 29%."

**Objectives:**

"Our primary objectives for this PI include:
1. **Building Metro 2 File De-tokenization:** We’re creating pivot tables using Spark DataFrames to convert Formatter outputs to Metro2 format files, implementing tokenization for both PAN & SSN, with a toggle feature including throttle enable.
2. **Achieving Test Maturity for CBR Assembler:** Ensuring the Assembler component meets Testing Maturity Level 3 standards as described by the Engineering Assurance team, and achieving 100% automation for critical and applicable non-critical component and live dependency testing."

**Milestones:**

"We aim to:
- Finish developing the De-tokenizer and generating Metro2 files from the Formatter output from S3, handling multiple file types including de-tokenization.
- By 8/7, set up DSIDs for CRAs and SBFE, establishing data shares and unblocking EFG routes for our next PI."

**Dependencies:**

"We have dependencies on:
- **7PS Testing:** Utilizing the AWS Glue pilot.
- **Turing Team:** For onboarding Card ECBR use cases and volume understanding.
- **Testing:** We require test data of unique SSNs/PANs in QA working with TDM."

**Risks/Impediments:**

"One key risk is the limited capacity in Sprint 1 due to the 4th of July week and PTO. We’re actively managing this to stay on track."

**Conclusion:**

"In summary, we’re confident in our progress with a confidence vote of 4. Thank you for your attention."
