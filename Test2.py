It applies configured Line of Business rules and suppression criteria to determine which accounts are eligible for credit bureau reporting and ensures that only one finalized record is created per account. The output is structured to support Metro 2 segment field population and related downstream reporting formats.
The dataset is primarily used by credit bureau reporting teams, credit risk partners, data engineering teams, and audit stakeholders who require a reliable and repeatable view of calculated account and customer attributes. It supports operational reporting, reconciliation activities, monitoring, and validation of bureau-ready outputs prior to submission. The data enables consumers to trace how reporting values were derived for compliance and accuracy checks.
Source data is obtained from United States Card systems of record, including account servicing platforms and joint customer reference data. The data is processed through Enterprise Credit Bureau Reporting transformation workflows, where records are validated, standardized, and aligned to Credit Reporting Resource Guide requirements before final delivery. These steps ensure consistency and readiness for external bureau submission.
