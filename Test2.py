The Calculated Accounts–Primary Customer dataset provides a summary of each account along with the associated primary customer information. It includes Capital One U.S. Card customer account-level data that has been processed through eCBR and structured according to the Credit Reporting Resource Guide (CRRG) standards. The dataset applies Line-of-Business (LOB) configured conditions and suppression logic to determine reportable records for delivery to the credit reporting agencies.

It presents information in an attribute-value format so downstream teams can consume a consistent set of calculated fields across multiple reporting formats, such as Metro2, SBFE, EWS, and CSV. Each record represents one account and its linked primary customer details needed for bureau reporting.
