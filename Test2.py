The dataset provides a full extract of posted transactions from the Omega System of Record, including transaction amount, posting date, source application, and the balance after posting. It also surfaces recoveries and the specific adjustments applied to individual balance buckets when a transaction is applied. Primary users are finance operations, recoveries and risk analysts, data engineers, and compliance/audit partners who rely on it for reconciliations, allocation validation, and regulatory reporting. Ingestion occurs daily through the transaction service pipeline.
