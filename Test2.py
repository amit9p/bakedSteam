Slide 5: EDQ Rule Sample

"This slide shows a sample EDQ rule defined in JSON format. The rule type used here is REGEX, which checks if the field contains only alphabetic characters. The passingRange section defines the thresholds that determine whether data is valid, using percentage bounds.

EDQ supports a wide range of rule typesâ€”like Not Null, Valid Values, Integer Range, and Regex, which are executed row by row. It also supports aggregate-level checks such as Mean, Minimum, and Maximum, and dataset-wide checks like Schema Validation or Column Match.

The JSON rule shown here is one example of how EDQ enforces data quality programmatically."
