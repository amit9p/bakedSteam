This dataset contains historical transactional details originally recorded in the legacy RECAP system for Omega charge-off accounts. It was migrated into OneStream as a legacy dataset to support archival, audit, and compliance requirements, but does not capture new or ongoing transactions. The primary users include finance operations teams, compliance and risk analysts, and auditors who rely on this data for reconciliation, historical reviews, and regulatory reporting.
