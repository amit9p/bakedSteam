The calculated accounts base segment summary dataset provides a consolidated account-level view for each reportable account that satisfies configured Line of Business (LOB) eligibility criteria and suppression rules. The dataset is designed to produce exactly one record per account, structured according to Metro 2 credit reporting segment field requirements, for downstream submission to external credit reporting agencies. Data is derived from multiple internal source systems, including customer master data, recoveries processing systems, fraud evaluation platforms, and Enterprise Data Quality (EDQ) outputs, to ensure accuracy, consistency, and regulatory compliance across reporting workflows.
