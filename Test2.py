The Calculated Accounts Primary Customer dataset provides account-level summaries for each reportable U.S. Card account and its linked primary customer. It applies Line-of-Business configuration and suppression logic required for delivery to credit reporting agencies, and structures the results in an attribute-value format so downstream systems can consume a consistent set of calculated Metro2 segment fields, as well as outputs for Small Business Financial Exchange (SBFE), Early Warning Services (EWS), and CSV formats. This dataset is primarily used by bureau reporting, credit risk, data engineering, and analytics teams who need a single, trusted view of calculated account and primary customer details for credit bureau reporting, monitoring, and reconciliation. The data originates from U.S. Card operational systems of record and is processed through the Enterprise Credit Bureau Reporting (eCBR) transformation jobs, where it is standardized according to the Credit Reporting Resource Guide (CRRG) and prepared for bureau submission.
