Prerequisites
Before executing the Glue job, ensure you have the following:

AWS Account: You need an active AWS account with permissions to create and manage Glue jobs, access S3, and manage IAM roles.
AWS CLI: Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).
Python Environment: Set up a Python environment to manage dependencies.
IAM Role: An IAM role with necessary permissions for Glue to access your S3 buckets and other AWS services.
Input Parameters
The Glue job requires the following input parameters:

input_s3_path: The S3 path where the input data is stored. This path should point to the location of the data that needs to be processed by the Glue job.
output_s3_path: The S3 path where the output data will be saved. This is the destination path where the processed data will be written.
credentials: AWS credentials with the necessary permissions to access the input and output S3 paths and to execute Glue jobs.
Job Details
The Glue job is configured with the following details:

Number of Partitions: 100 partitions are used to optimize data processing and writing to the output S3 path.
Number of Workers: The job is configured to utilize 100 workers to ensure efficient data processing and parallel execution.
Arguments: All necessary arguments, including the input and output paths and credentials, are specified in the job configuration.
Execution
To execute the Glue job, follow these steps:

Upload the Job Script: Upload the Python script for the Glue job to an S3 bucket that is accessible by your Glue service role.
Create the Glue Job:
Go to the AWS Glue Console.
Create a new Glue job and configure the job details.
Specify the S3 path to the Python script.
Add the required input parameters (input_s3_path, output_s3_path, credentials).
Specify Python Dependencies: Add any additional Python module dependencies that are not included in the AWS Glue environment.
Run the Job: Start the Glue job from the AWS Glue Console, CLI, or using a boto3 script.
Running the Job via AWS CLI
To run the job using the AWS CLI, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
aws glue start-job-run \
  --job-name your-glue-job-name \
  --arguments '--input_s3_path=s3://your-input-path,--output_s3_path=s3://your-output-path,--credentials=your-credentials'
Python Module Dependencies
Ensure the following Python modules are included in your Glue job configuration:

[List any additional modules needed]
To add dependencies, you can package them as a .whl or .egg file and specify them in the Glue job configuration.

Best Practices
Data Partitioning: Use an appropriate number of partitions (100 in this job) to balance parallelism and resource utilization.
Worker Configuration: Allocate a sufficient number of workers (100 for this job) based on data size and processing requirements.
Error Handling: Implement error handling and logging to track job execution and diagnose failures.
Resource Management: Monitor job performance and adjust the number of workers and partitions as needed to optimize cost and processing time.
