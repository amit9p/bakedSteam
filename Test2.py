✅ FINAL DESCRIPTION (Strengthened for “Source”)

The Calculated Accounts J2 Customer dataset provides account-level summaries for each reportable U.S. Card account and its associated J2 customer. It applies Line-of-Business configuration rules and suppression logic required for delivery to credit reporting agencies. The dataset organizes results in an attribute-value structure so downstream systems can consume a consistent set of calculated Metro2 segment fields, along with outputs for Small Business Financial Exchange (SBFE), Early Warning Services (EWS), and CSV formats.

This dataset is intended for bureau reporting teams, credit risk groups, data engineering partners, and analytics users who require a trusted and consistent view of calculated account and J2 customer details for reporting, monitoring, reconciliation, and audit needs. It helps downstream consumers generate bureau-ready summaries and verify reporting accuracy within their workflows.

The data originates from U.S. Card operational systems of record, including account data and J2 customer attributes. It is processed through the Enterprise Credit Bureau Reporting (eCBR) transformation workflows, where it is enriched, validated, standardized according to the Credit Reporting Resource Guide (CRRG), and prepared for bureau submission. This pipeline ensures that all records align to Metro2 requirements before delivery.
