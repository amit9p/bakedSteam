The Formatted Fields dataset provides US Card customer account information that has been processed through the Capital One Enterprise Credit Bureau Reporting (eCBR) pipeline. The data is standardized according to the Credit Reporting Resource Guide (CRRG) to ensure consistency and support multiple downstream reporting formats.

This dataset organizes fields in an attribute–value structure so that consumers do not need to apply bureau-specific formatting rules themselves. It can be used to generate several credit-reporting formats including Metro2, S2FS, EWS, CSV, and others.

This dataset is intended for teams that prepare, validate, or analyze credit bureau submissions, including data engineering, quality, compliance, and reporting users. It helps users retrieve structured, ready-to-consume customer account information without having to manage raw input transformations.
