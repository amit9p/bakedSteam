Section,Description,Details
Job Configuration,Worker Type and Number of Workers,Choose the appropriate worker type based on the memory and compute needs. Start with a lower number of workers and scale up as needed.
Job Configuration,DPUs (Data Processing Units),"Monitor the job’s performance and adjust DPUs accordingly. Over-provisioning increases costs, while under-provisioning may cause jobs to fail."
Job Configuration,Job Timeout,Set a reasonable timeout to avoid long-running jobs that can accrue high costs. Consider adding retry logic for transient errors.
Job Configuration,IAM Roles and Permissions,Use the principle of least privilege. Ensure that the IAM role has only the necessary permissions required for the job execution.
Best Practices (Dos),Data Partitioning,Partition your data to optimize read performance and reduce costs by processing only the relevant partitions.
Best Practices (Dos),Monitoring and Logging,"Enable detailed logging and monitoring through AWS CloudWatch to track job performance, errors, and cost metrics."
Best Practices (Dos),Job Script Optimization,Write efficient ETL scripts by minimizing shuffles and using filter and select operations early.
Best Practices (Dos),Data Formats,Prefer columnar data formats like Parquet or ORC over row-based formats like CSV for better performance and lower costs.
Best Practices (Dos),Incremental Processing,"Use incremental data processing to reduce the volume of data processed, thus lowering costs and improving performance."
Pitfalls to Avoid (Don'ts),Over-Provisioning Resources,Don’t allocate excessive DPUs or choose high-memory workers without assessing actual job needs.
Pitfalls to Avoid (Don'ts),Ignoring Data Skew,"Avoid data processing that results in skewed distributions, as this can cause inefficiencies and increased costs."
Pitfalls to Avoid (Don'ts),Neglecting Error Handling,Don’t overlook the importance of robust error handling in your ETL scripts.
Pitfalls to Avoid (Don'ts),Hard-Coding Configurations,Avoid hard-coding parameters or configurations in scripts. Use Glue’s job parameters feature.
Pitfalls to Avoid (Don'ts),Running Jobs on Full Datasets Unnecessarily,Don’t run jobs on full datasets if processing can be optimized using incremental processing or data partitioning.
Common Challenges and Solutions,Job Memory Errors or Resource Exhaustion,Optimize the job script to reduce memory usage or choose a worker type with higher memory capacity.
Common Challenges and Solutions,Long Execution Times,Review the job script for inefficiencies and consider increasing the number of DPUs or using more powerful worker types.
Common Challenges and Solutions,High Costs,Monitor Glue job costs through AWS Cost Explorer. Adjust the DPU allocation and optimize ETL scripts.
Future Improvements,Automation and Scheduling,Implement job scheduling using AWS Glue Workflows or AWS Step Functions.
Future Improvements,Resource Tagging,Tag Glue jobs and associated resources to track costs effectively.
Future Improvements,Advanced Monitoring,Use AWS CloudWatch dashboards for real-time monitoring and alerts on Glue job performance and costs.
